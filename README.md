# Stroop Effect Game

The Stroop Effect Game is a simple React-based web application that challenges users with a cognitive test. The game displays color names in various colors, and the player's task is to quickly select the correct color, not the word's meaning. 

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in React, including state management, conditional rendering, and the use of Tailwind CSS for styling.
